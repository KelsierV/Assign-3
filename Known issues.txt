employee equals method does nothing?
program crashes when incorrect input happens (e.g. a letter) for all nextInt nextDoubles
program allows negative values as input
program allows numbers as input for name and letters for id 
For some reason we are checking the name in add employee so I changed it to the number, duplicate names should be allowed. Therefore you can delete validatename method if you agree
Does not remove employee from file? do we even need to remove it from the file?
Should we have another file? Word doc -> This file will serve as the input file for next week so that it should be in the same format as the input file.
