employee equals still incomplete so checks are not happening when adding employees (validator)
program crashes when incorrect input happens (e.g. a letter) for all nextInt nextDoubles
program allows negative values as input
program allows numbers as input for name and letters for id 
Employee ID can be the same
Does not remove employee from file? do we even need to remove it from the file?
Should we have another file? Word doc -> This file will serve as the input file for next week so that it should be in the same format as the input file.
